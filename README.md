# AI FOR GOOD: Organ Transplant Matching & Administrative Automation

Welcome to our **AI FOR GOOD** repository! This project leverages **Next.js** on the frontend, a **Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system for organizing medical data, and **Groq** for ultra-fast AI inference and analytics. Our goal is to streamline organ transplant matching by integrating patient and donor data, performing real-time compatibility analytics, and presenting results via an interactive user interface.

## Project Overview

**Objective**  
We aim to solve the critical bottlenecks in organ transplantation—inefficient matching, administrative overhead, and delayed paperwork—by building an **end-to-end solution** that:
- **Ingests patient & donor data** into a knowledge graph.
- **Uses Graph RAG** to quickly retrieve and relate medical and logistical information.
- **Analyzes data with Groq** for real-time organ matching and compatibility scoring.
- **Displays** results on an interactive **Next.js** frontend.

Our solution is designed to reduce wait times, minimize errors, and improve outcomes for patients in need of life-saving transplants.

## Tech Stack

1. **Next.js (React Framework)**
   - Provides a responsive, modern frontend for data visualization and user interactions.
2. **Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
   - Organizes and retrieves patient and donor data efficiently through a knowledge graph.
3. **Groq**
   - Delivers ultra-fast AI inference for real-time data analytics and compatibility scoring.
4. **Node.js / TypeScript**
   - Powers server-side logic and orchestrates communication between the frontend, Groq, and graph systems.
5. **Neo4j (Optional)**
   - A graph database for storing relationships between patients and donors.
6. **CSS / Tailwind**
   - Provides the UI/UX foundation for a clean, modern look.

## Key Features

1. **Patient & Donor Data Integration**
   - Import data from CSV/Excel files containing key fields such as `patient_id`, `blood_type`, `organ_needed`, `location`, `wait_time`, `medical_urgency`, etc.
2. **Graph RAG for Matching**
   - Structures medical data into a graph, allowing quick and contextual retrieval of matching candidates.
3. **Groq-Powered Analytics**
   - Uses Groq’s high-speed inference to compute real-time compatibility scores based on criteria like urgency, wait time, blood/tissue compatibility, and geographical proximity.
4. **Next.js Frontend**
   - Displays matches and detailed analytics via an interactive dashboard that updates in real time.
5. **Scalable & Modular Design**
   - Easily extendable to add features like scheduling, logistics optimization, or automated compliance document generation.

## AI Model & Implementation

**How It Works:**
- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:**  
  Patient and donor data are ingested through CSV/Excel uploads and normalized before being stored in a knowledge graph.
  
- **Graph RAG Integration:**  
  The system organizes data into a graph structure (optionally using Neo4j) to capture complex relationships between donors and patients. This enables quick retrieval and relevance-based matching.
  
- **Groq Analytics:**  
  Groq is used to analyze data in real time. By processing compatibility factors—medical urgency, wait time, and blood/tissue compatibility—the system returns a score and a detailed analysis of the best match.
  
- **User Interface:**  
  The Next.js frontend displays the results, including detailed information on matched patients/donors, alongside interactive data visualizations.

## Setup & Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

1. **Clone the Repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/M4T1SS3/AI-FOR-GOOD_START.git
   cd AI-FOR-GOOD_START
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

4. **Edit & Customize:**
   - Modify files in `client/app/` (e.g., `page.tsx`) to see live updates.

## Usage Guide

- **Frontend Interaction:**  
  The Next.js interface allows you to view patient/donor data, run matching analytics, and see real-time results on a dynamic dashboard.
  
- **Data Analysis:**  
  Use the provided Groq analysis scripts in the `server/groq/` directory to process CSV/Excel data and compute compatibility scores.
  
- **Graph Matching:**  
  The Graph RAG system (and optional Neo4j integration) organizes and queries data, helping identify the best matches based on urgency, wait time, and compatibility.
  
- **Running Tests:**  
  Execute tests (if available) using your preferred testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha) to verify functionality.

## Ethical Considerations & Limitations

- **Fairness & Bias:**  
  While the system is designed to minimize human bias, AI models may still inherit biases from training data. Continuous monitoring and regular updates are essential.
  
- **Data Privacy:**  
  Ensure all patient and donor data is anonymized and handled in compliance with applicable regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
  
- **Transparency & Accountability:**  
  Maintain detailed logs and explainability features so that medical professionals can understand and trust the AI's recommendations.
  
- **Regulatory Compliance:**  
  The system must adhere to standards for medical data management and documentation. Regular audits and compliance checks are recommended.
