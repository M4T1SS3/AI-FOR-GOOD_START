# AI FOR GOOD: Organ Transplant Matching & Administrative Automation

Welcome to our **AI FOR GOOD** repository! This project leverages **Next.js** on the frontend, a **Graph RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, and **Groq** for ultra-fast data processing and analytics. Our goal is to streamline organ transplant matching by integrating patient/donor data, real-time analytics, and an interactive UI.

## **Project Overview**

**Objective**  
We aim to solve the critical bottleneck in organ transplantation—inefficient matching, administrative overhead, and delayed paperwork—by building an **end-to-end solution** that:
- **Ingests patient & donor data** into a knowledge graph.
- **Uses Graph RAG** to quickly retrieve relevant medical and logistical information.
- **Analyzes data with Groq** for real-time organ matching.
- **Displays** the results on a user-friendly **Next.js** frontend.

By combining these technologies, we hope to **reduce wait times**, **minimize errors**, and **improve outcomes** for patients in need of organ transplants.

## **Tech Stack**

1. **Next.js (React Framework)**  
   - Provides the frontend for data visualization, user interactions, and real-time updates.

2. **Graph RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
   - Manages the knowledge graph containing **patient** and **donor** data (e.g., blood type, organ needed/available, location, wait time).

3. **Groq**  
   - Ultra-fast AI inference for data analysis, compatibility scoring, and real-time recommendations.

4. **Node.js / TypeScript**  
   - Underpins the server-side logic and orchestrates calls to Groq and the graph system.

5. **Neo4j or Similar Graph Database** *(optional integration)*  
   - Stores relationships between patients, donors, and their respective attributes.

6. **CSS / Tailwind / Other** *(depending on styling choice)*  
   - Provides the UI/UX foundation.

---

## **Key Features**

1. **Patient & Donor Data Integration**  
   - Import CSV/Excel data for patients (medical urgency, location, etc.) and donors (organ type, location, tissue type).

2. **Graph RAG for Matching**  
   - Organizes medical data into a graph structure, allowing quick retrieval of best matches.

3. **Groq-Powered Analytics**  
   - Ultra-fast data processing for real-time organ matching and compliance checks.

4. **Next.js Frontend**  
   - Interactive UI to display matches, highlight urgency, and simplify data exploration.

5. **Scalable & Modular**  
   - Easily adapt to additional features such as scheduling, logistics optimization, or compliance document generation.

## **Setup & Development**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

1. **Clone the Repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/M4T1SS3/AI-FOR-GOOD_START.git
   cd AI-FOR-GOOD_START
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

4. **Edit & Customize**  
   - Modify `app/page.tsx` or other pages to see live updates in development.

## **How It Works**

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Upload or import patient/donor data (e.g., CSV) into the backend or graph database.  
   - This data includes fields like `patient_id`, `blood_type`, `organ_needed`, `location`, `wait_time`, `medical_urgency`, etc.

2. **Graph RAG & Groq Analysis**  
   - The system uses a knowledge graph (e.g., Neo4j or an in-memory graph) to store relationships.  
   - Groq is called to quickly analyze compatibility scores, factoring in:
     - **Medical urgency**  
     - **Wait time**  
     - **Blood/tissue compatibility**  
     - **Geographical proximity**

3. **Frontend Visualization**  
   - Next.js displays the best matches in real time, highlighting urgent cases and providing user-friendly dashboards.

4. **Administrative Automation** *(Optional Next Step)*  
   - Generate or auto-fill compliance documents, schedule logistics, and handle additional workflows.

---

## **Progress & Steps**

1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - Created Next.js boilerplate, set up basic routes, and tested the environment.

2. **Backend Integration**:  
   - Experimented with data ingestion scripts for patient and donor CSV files.

3. **Graph RAG Prototype**:  
   - Established a sample graph-based data model to link patients and donors.  
   - Implemented basic retrieval logic to show potential matches.

4. **Groq Integration**:  
   - Added a Groq client to perform ultra-fast analytics and real-time scoring.  
   - Tested multiple scenarios to ensure quick response times.

5. **Frontend Display**:  
   - Built minimal UI to list top matches, highlight urgent cases, and confirm next steps.

6. **Future Enhancements**:  
   - Add advanced search, filtering, or scheduling.  
   - Integrate logistics optimization (organ transport routes, timing).  
   - Generate compliance and documentation automatically.
